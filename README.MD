## 关于游戏

生命游戏是模拟细胞生成过程的游戏。一些细胞可能会死亡而一些细胞可以存活。它取决于自然选择的环境。在不同的初始情况下，细胞可以以不同的方式生成，这将呈现出惊人的图形。

The life game is the game to simulate the cell's generating processing. Some cells may die while some cells can survive. It depend on the environment according to natural selection. In a different initial situation, cells can generate in different way which will present an amazing graphic.

## 游戏规则

细胞的状态取决于该细胞周围的细胞数量：

如果数量小于2，则单元格将死亡。

如果数量是2，则单元格将处于活动状态。

如果数量为3，则单元格状态不会改变。

如果数量超过3，则该单元格将死亡。

The cell's state is depend on the number of cells around this cell.

If the number is less than 2, the cell will be dead.

If the number is 2, the cell will be alive.

If the number is 3, the cell state won't change.

If the number is more than 3, this cell will be dead.
